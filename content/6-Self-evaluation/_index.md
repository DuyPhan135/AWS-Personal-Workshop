During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Limited** from September 8, 2025, to December 12, 2025, I had the valuable opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired at university to a real-world working environment while gaining numerous practical experiences.

I participated in the development of a Web Chat application and the deployment of the product on the AWS platform. Through this process, I significantly improved my programming skills, enhanced my ability to quickly grasp new technologies, mastered project configuration and AWS service deployment, and further developed teamwork and communication skills among team members.

In terms of professional attitude, I always strived to complete assigned tasks to the best of my ability, strictly followed company rules and regulations, and actively discussed with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
