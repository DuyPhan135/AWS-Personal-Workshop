### [Blog 1 - Build character consistent storyboards using Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock – Part 1](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces how to build character-consistent storyboards using Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock. You will learn why maintaining consistent character design and visual style is challenging in AI-generated content, and how structured prompt engineering, style descriptions, and fixed parameters like seed and cfgScale can improve results. The article also shows how to set up a storyboard development pipeline by combining Amazon Nova Lite for optimized prompts with Amazon Nova Canvas for image generation, and how to extend the workflow with Amazon Nova Reel to create short animated storyboards.

### [Blog 2 - Stream Amazon DynamoDB table data to Amazon S3 Tables for analytics](3.2-Blog2/)

This post shows how to stream data from Amazon DynamoDB to Amazon S3 Tables for analytics using AWS managed services. It covers two main patterns: DynamoDB Streams with Lambda and Firehose, and Kinesis Data Streams for higher throughput and retention. The solution uses S3 Tables’ Iceberg format for efficient, scalable analytics, integrates with AWS services like Athena, and automates deployment and governance with AWS CDK and Lake Formation. Step-by-step instructions guide you through setup, data streaming, querying, and maintenance, enabling a serverless, low-maintenance data lake architecture.

### [Blog 3 - Build character consistent storyboards using Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock – Part 2](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog demonstrates how to fine-tune Amazon Nova Canvas in Amazon Bedrock to achieve professional-grade character consistency in storyboards. It explains an automated workflow that extracts and labels training data from video using Amazon S3, ECS, and Rekognition, then fine-tunes a Nova Canvas model with Bedrock APIs. You will learn how to prepare diverse character datasets, generate captions with Nova Pro, and validate data with Amazon A2I. The article also shows step-by-step instructions for creating fine-tuning jobs via the Bedrock console and Python SDK, deploying custom models with provisioned throughput, and testing them to generate new consistent storyboard images.

### [Blog 4 - Accelerating HPC and AI research in universities with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](3.4-Blog4/)

This blog explains how universities can speed up AI and HPC research with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a managed solution that simplifies scaling, storage, and cluster management. By integrating NVIDIA GPUs, FSx for Lustre, and S3, along with features like SLURM customization, cost tracking, and federated access, HyperPod helps institutions optimize resources and budgets so researchers can focus on science instead of infrastructure.
