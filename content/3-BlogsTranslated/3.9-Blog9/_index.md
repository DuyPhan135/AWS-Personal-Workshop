# Your unified view of travelers and guests from Amazon Connect Customer Profiles

Historically, travel and hospitality companies relied on loyalty programs to do exactly that—build loyalty. However, a [McKinsey & Company report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/travel-invented-loyalty-as-we-know-it-now-its-time-for-reinvention) shows that loyalty is in decline. The same study from McKinsey advises that travel and hospitality companies can win loyalty by “offering distinctive, satisfying experiences” through more personalized engagement.

The key to delighting customers and providing the seamless experience they crave starts with accurate customer data. Today, we’re excited to announce [Amazon Connect Customer Profiles](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customer-profiles/) for travel and hospitality, a new industry-specific capability within Amazon Connect that helps travel and hospitality companies deliver more personalized experiences across every customer touchpoint.

In this blog, we’ll explore how travel and hospitality companies can now use Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to create unified traveler and guest profiles, improve data collaboration for marketing campaigns, partnership, and measurement, and use generative AI to offer more personalized engagements and service.

## Unifying customer data is challenging

While every organization aspires to a single view of the customer, those in the travel and hospitality industry know how challenging this can be. Travel and hospitality companies sit on a trove of first-party data. However, that customer data is siloed. It can live in booking tools, property management systems, loyalty systems, contact centers, and more. It can be in the cloud or on premises. It can be structured or unstructured. It can be used to enhance the traveler and guest journey at every step but only after it’s merged into a unified view of the customer. This fragmentation makes it difficult to deliver consistent, personalized experiences across channels and touchpoints.

Amazon Connect Customer Profiles now addresses these challenges by providing a purpose-built mapping for common travel and hospitality applications. It comes with pre-configured data models specifically designed for travel and hospitality use cases, ensuring that companies can quickly implement a unified view of the customer that understands their unique needs. The service combines customer data from over 75 sources, including leading Customer Data Platforms, (CDPs) engagement platforms, and specialized travel and hospitality applications, through automated data ingestion and unification processes.

## Enriching customer data

Real-time profile resolution uses rules-based deduplication to ensure accurate, unified customer profiles. This enables companies to have a comprehensive view of each customer at any given moment. Amazon Connect Customer Profiles are always up-to-date with real-time connections to data sources, ensuring you always know the latest about your customer.

Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is built to handle enterprise-grade scale, supporting terabytes of data with sub-50ms performance to meet the needs of the world’s largest organizations. Additionally, it’s available in 10 regions globally with built-in compliance for standards such as GDPR, PCI, HIPAA, and CCPA, ensuring that companies can use the service while adhering to various regulatory requirements.

## Activating in Amazon Connect and beyond

With unified Amazon Connect Customer Profiles, organizations can activate customer data across multiple channels and at multiple touchpoints. Customers using Amazon Connect will experience a more efficient self-service experience, through either more efficient routing or more personalized responses in chat. Amazon Connect agents can access complete customer context, enabling more personalized interactions where human reasoning is required.

Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is further enhanced with generative AI capabilities, including an AI assistant to help create actionable segments or calculated attributes to help better predict customer behavior. These features allow companies to not only understand their customers better but also anticipate their needs and preferences.
