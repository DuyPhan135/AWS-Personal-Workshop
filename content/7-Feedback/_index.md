### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is extremely friendly and open. All FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy, comfortable, and helps me stay focused. However, I suggest adding a few more casual gatherings or team-bonding activities so everyone can get to know each other better.

**2. Support from Mentor & Team Admin**  
My mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained concepts clearly when I didn’t understand, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The team admin was excellent in handling paperwork, preparing documents, and creating favorable conditions for my work. I truly appreciate that the mentor let me try and solve problems on my own first instead of giving direct answers.

**3. Alignment between Tasks and Academic Background**  
The tasks assigned were well-aligned with the knowledge I gained at university while also exposing me to completely new areas I had never encountered before. This combination allowed me to both reinforce my foundation and acquire practical real-world skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
Throughout the internship, I acquired many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared a lot of real-world experience that has helped me better shape my future career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously yet remains cheerful. When there’s a tight deadline, the whole team pulls together and supports one another regardless of position. This made me feel like a true part of the team, even as “just an intern.”

**6. Policies & Benefits for Interns**  
The company provides internship allowances and offers flexible scheduling when needed. Being able to join internal training sessions for free is a huge plus.

### Additional Questions

**What satisfied you the most during the internship?**  
The feeling of learning and absorbing new knowledge every single day.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
It would be helpful to prepare a more detailed learning roadmap from the very first week (e.g., weeks 1–2: learn specific tools; weeks 3–4: work on certain tasks, etc.) so that newcomers don’t feel overwhelmed during the initial 1–2 weeks.

**If you were to recommend this internship to your friends, would you encourage them to join? Why?**  
Absolutely yes! This program doesn’t only teach technical skills—it also teaches professional working habits and problem-solving mindset.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**What suggestions do you have to improve the internship experience?**  
It would be great if the mentors could align more consistently with each other when making decisions and giving instructions.

**Would you like to continue with this program in the future?**  
Definitely yes!
