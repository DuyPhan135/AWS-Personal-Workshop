### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. Members of the FCJ team are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me stay focused. However, I think it would be beneficial to have more bonding or social activities so everyone can understand each other better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained clearly whenever I didn’t understand, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The admin team supported administrative tasks, provided necessary documents, and created good conditions for me to work effectively. I truly appreciate that my mentor allowed me to try and solve problems on my own instead of giving me the answer directly.

**3. Alignment Between the Work and My Field of Study**  
The tasks I was assigned closely aligned with the knowledge I learned at university, while also exposing me to new areas that I had never encountered before. This helped me reinforce my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills that will better support my future career direction.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared valuable practical experiences that helped me gain clearer career orientation.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects one another and maintains a working attitude that is serious yet comfortable. Throughout the learning and knowledge-sharing process, everyone is willing to support and share their experience regardless of position or role. This helped me clearly feel that even as an intern, I was treated as part of the team and had a supportive environment to grow.

### Additional Questions

**What are you most satisfied with during the internship?**  
The feeling of being able to learn and absorb new knowledge every day.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
It would be helpful to establish a clear and unified process for workshops to avoid unclear communication. This time, the information I received about workshop requirements varied from person to person, which caused confusion. I hope the admin team can align expectations in advance and make a single announcement at the beginning of the internship so the program can continue to improve.

**Would you recommend this internship to your friends? Why?**  
Definitely yes. Interning here offers many valuable experiences in a real working environment, opportunities to learn new knowledge, and a chance to connect what we study in school with practical scenarios.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
There should be more consistency in decision-making among mentors. As mentioned above, each mentor provided different feedback when reviewing the workshop assignments. In this round, I was first informed that the deadline for the proposal and architecture was November 22, but then later told that it needed to be submitted a few days earlier for grading. It's not a major issue for me, but having clarity and alignment would help everyone work more effectively and grow together.

Lastly, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to join the program to learn and gain experience. These are simply my suggestions so future interns can have an even better learning environment. I wish everyone success in continuing to grow the FCJ program.
