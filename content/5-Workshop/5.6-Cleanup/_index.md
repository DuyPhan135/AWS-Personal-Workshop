#### 1. Clean up the backend service generated by terraform

To clean up the backend service created by terraform, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

The command will prompt you to confirm the destruction of the resources. Type `yes` and press Enter to proceed.

Upon successful completion, you will see a message indicating that the resources have been destroyed, but in this case, there are 2 errors which are `deleting-s3-bucket` and `ECR-Repository`. This is because the S3 bucket is not empty and the ECR repository contains images.

In order to completely remove the S3 bucket and ECR repository, you need to manually delete the objects in the S3 bucket and the images in the ECR repository on AWS Management Console.

#### 2. Delete objects in the S3 bucket

1. Go to the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).

2. Find the bucket named `webchat-app-dev-uploads-2025-sg123456` like in the screenshot below and click on it.

3. We need to empty the bucket before deleting it. Click on the "Empty" button.

4. Confirm the action by typing "permanently delete" in the input box and click on the "Empty bucket" button. After a few moments, the bucket will be emptied.

5. Now, go back to the S3 bucket list, select the bucket again, and click on the "Delete" button to delete the empty bucket.

6. Confirm the deletion by typing the bucket name and clicking on the "Delete" button.

#### 3. Delete images in the ECR repository

1. Go to the [ECR console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).
2. Find the repository named `webchat-app-dev-backend` and click on it.
3. Select all images in the repository by checking the checkbox next to "Image Tag".
4. Click on the "Delete" button to delete the selected images.
5. Confirm the image deletion by typing "delete" in the input box and clicking on the "Delete" button.

6. After deleting all images in the repository, go back to the terminal and run the `terraform destroy` command again:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

This time, the command should complete successfully without any errors.

After completing these steps, you have successfully cleaned up the backend service and all associated resources created by terraform.

#### 4. Clean up the deployed Frontend service with Amplify.

1. Access Amazon Amplify, select the App you deployed.

![Clean Up Amplify](/images/5-Workshop/5.6-Cleanup/cleanupfe.png)

2. From the left sidebar, select App Settings -> General settings.

3. In the Delete app section, select the Delete app button.

4. Enter "delete" to confirm you want to delete this App, then click the Delete app button.

5. A notification confirms the App deletion was successful, so the Frontend App has been cleaned up.

After completing the above steps, we have finished cleaning up the Frontend on the Amplify service, next we will clean up the Hosted Zone that we created for the Domain to point to this Hosted Zone.

#### 5. Clean up the Hosted Zone in Route53.

1. Access Route53 -> Hosted Zone, select the Hosted Zone you need to clean up.

2. Select all Records except the 2 default Records which are NS and SOA. Select Delete records.

3. Review and click Delete.

![Clean Up Hosted Zone2](/images/5-Workshop/5.6-Cleanup/cleanuphostedzone2.png)

4. After successful deletion, go back to Hosted Zone, select the Hosted Zone to be cleaned up, click Delete.

5. Enter delete to confirm you want to delete this Hosted Zone, click Delete.
